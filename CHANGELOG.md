> ### DynamicSurroundings-Fabric-1.20.1-0.3.0
**Requirements**
* JAVA 17+ (I am using Adoptium https://adoptium.net/)
* Fabric Loader >=0.14.22
* Fabric API >=0.91.0+1.20.1
* 100% client side; no server side deployment needed

* **NOTICE**
* I do not plan on adding additional features to the 1.20.1 version. The 1.20.4 version will be my focus. I will make patches to 1.20.1 as needed.

**What's New**
* Added a global option to disable scary sounds. Currently, this applies to the wolf and the underground monster growl. Scary is subjective, so I would be glad to hear opinions about other sounds in the mod. This only applies to sounds generated by Dynamic Surroundings. If another mod has a scary sound, you can block it using the Individual Sound Control GUI in game (assuming the keybind is mapped).
* Added a global volume scale setting for ambient sounds. This applies only to Dynamic Surroundings sound effects. Intended to give a simple knob to increase/decrease the volume of the mod's environmental sounds.

**Changes**
* Reworked the internal tagging for items, blocks, and biomes. The mod no longer declares tags in /data. The mod's tag configuration has been moved into client side resources. (I have my own tag scanning code for loading tag information as the mod is 100% client side.)
* Added resource support for Biomes O'Plenty, Nature's Spirit, Profundis, and Promenade.

**Fixes**
* Minimal particle settings can cause mod to crash with waterfall effects.
* Disconnecting and reconnecting can result in the loss of biome sound effects.
* Footstep sound effects would not play when connected to a remote server.
